I'm a research engineer with 13+ years experience in wireless communications, where I worked on 4G, 
5G and 6G radio access networks as well as satellite transmission systems.

Before that, I spent nearly a decade in academia diving deep into wireless and satellite
communications.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electronics and Communications ad a Laurea degree in Telecommunications
Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it), Italy.

My main research passion is **error correction codes** in all their flavors — from coding for broadband transmissions to ultra-reliable communications, short block length codes, nonlinear and nonbinary codes, and even quantum error correction codes!

Lately, I’ve been experimenting with deep learning for designing new types of error correction codes for channels with feedback.
