Hi and welcome to my home page!

I'm a research engineer with 13+ years experience in wireless communications, where I worked on 4G, 5G and 6G  networks as well as terrestrial and satellite digital video broadcasting systems.

Before that, I spent nearly a decade in academia diving deep into broadband wireless and satellite communications.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electronics and Communications ad a Laurea degree in Telecommunications Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it), Italy.

These days, my main research passions are 
- Error correction codes in all their flavors — from broadband to ultra-reliable, short block length, nonlinear, and even quantum!
- Modulations and waveforms
- Multiple access methods

Lately, I’ve also been experimenting with deep learning for designing new types of error correction codes — a mix of classic theory and modern AI.

Check out my [publications](/publications) and [patents](/patents).

Thanks for stopping by!
