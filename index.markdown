Hi and welcome to my home page!

I'm a research engineer with 13+ years experience in wireless communications, where I worked on 4G, 
5G and 6G networks as well as terrestrial and satellite digital video broadcasting systems.

Before that, I spent nearly a decade in academia diving deep into broadband wireless and satellite
communications.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electronics and Communications ad a Laurea degree in Telecommunications
Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it), Italy.

My main research passion is **error correction coding** in all their flavors — from coding for broadband transmissions to ultra-reliable communications, short block length codes, nonlinear and nonbinary codes, and even quantum error correction codes!

Lately, I’ve also been experimenting with deep learning for designing new types of error correction codes — a mix of classic theory and modern AI.

Check out my [publications](/publications) and [patents](/patents).

Thanks for stopping by!
