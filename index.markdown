Hi and welcome to my home page!

I'm a research engineer with 13+ years experience in wireless communications, where I worked on 4G
and 5G radio access networks as well as terrestrial and satellite digital video broadcasting.

Before that, I spent nearly a decade in academia diving deep into wireless and satellite communications.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electronics and Communications ad a *Laurea*[^1] degree in Telecommunications
Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it), Italy.

My main research passion is **error correction codes** in all their flavors — from coding for broadband transmissions to ultra-reliable communications, short block length codes, nonlinear and nonbinary codes, and even quantum error correction!

Lately, I’ve been experimenting with **deep learning** for designing new types of error correction codes for channels with feedback.

Check out my [publications](/publications) and [patents](/patents).

Thanks for stopping by!

[^1]: In the Italian academic system before the 1999 reform, the *laurea* degree was the highest academic degree obtainable before Ph.D. It is considered equivalent to a masters' degree.
